#summary The C++ style guide for this project.

For the most part we follow the [http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml Google C++ style guide]. The exceptions are:

  * We prefix getters with `get_` for clarification
  * We disallow use of "using std::string" because it can cause conflicts in codebases that define a modified string class
  * TODO: others
